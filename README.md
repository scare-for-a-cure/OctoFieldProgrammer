# OctoFieldProgrammer
Arduino program to redo scene on octobanger like you would a PicoBoo.

This program is to setup an arduino to be able to reprogram an octobanger programmed arduino without needing to take it back to the computer.

We want the use of this device to be as straight forward as programming a PicoBoo

We would have a record button that when you press will start recording the button presses. While your running the program your presses will activate the correspoding output.

Once the sequence is done, you press the record button again and it will transmit the new sequence to the Octobanger.






# OctoBanger
octobanger is a freeware gui program used to setup and control arduino's for haunted house prop effects. The gui allows easy control and sequencing of up to 8 relay outputs without needing to know any programmign to get it to run on an arduino.

This project is not looking to modify anything about the original software, simply to create a hand held field programmer for projects that have used it. To add more capability.

Some of the octobanger code is included here for reference, as i havent been able to find a repository with its code available.
